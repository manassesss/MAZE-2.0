## :cake: Project
This is a second version of a personal app to my mom administrate your work, [Mazé](https://github.com/manassesss/MAZE/). She works with a party buffet and has some difficulties with managing orders and stocks of products used to make cakes and other things. Allied to that, I need to practice my skills with TypeScript and React-Native. For this reason, I decide to do another version of the first one to help her and me.

For now, two flows have been thought of when using the app. The inventory control flow and the order scheduling flow.

### Inventory Control Flow
Regarding stock control, it will be possible to register, as well as edit an item in the stock of products used in the production of any of the products produced by Mazé. In addition, it will be possible to view these items through a simple listing.

### Order Scheduling Flow
Orders can be scheduled and organized according to the type of event. In this flow, the information requested to add or edit an order is still being reviewed, but for now, only that information is being allocated.
